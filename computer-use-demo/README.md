# Computer Use Demo

This directory is intended to contain the [Anthropic Quickstarts Computer Use Demo](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo) frontend. Due to network restrictions in the development environment, the files were not automatically fetched.

To set it up locally, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts.git
cp -r anthropic-quickstarts/computer-use-demo/* ./computer-use-demo/
```

Then install dependencies and run the frontend:

```bash
cd computer-use-demo
npm install
npm run dev
```
