# CambioML Computer Use Backend

This project provides a minimal FastAPI backend for managing chat sessions and
messages. It offers REST endpoints for creating sessions, posting messages, and
retrieving history, backed by a SQLite database via SQLAlchemy.

## Running the application

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This will start the API server on `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

- `POST /sessions` – create a new session.
- `GET /sessions` – list all sessions.
- `POST /sessions/{session_id}/messages` – add a message to a session.
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}/messages` – retrieve all messages for a session.
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}/vnc` – obtain a VNC URL for the session.

The project also includes a simple WebSocket echo endpoint at `/ws`.

## Using with Anthropic Quickstarts

This backend can be paired with the [Anthropic Quickstarts Computer Use Demo](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo).
Run this API server and then start the quickstart front end. The front end will
communicate with the endpoints above and use `/sessions/{id}/vnc` to retrieve
the VNC connection URL.
